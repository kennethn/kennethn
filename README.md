### Hi there, I'm Ken 👋

I'm a Product Management [Coach](https://www.kennorton.com/coaching/), [Speaker](https://www.kennorton.com/speaking/), and [Bringer of Donuts](https://www.kennorton.com/donuts/). I spent fourteen years at Google where I worked on Google Docs, Google Calendar, Google Mobile Maps, and GV. I've written a lot about the craft of product management on my personal website, at [kennorton.com](https://www.kennorton.com).
