### Hi there, I'm Ken ðŸ‘‹

I'm a product manager at Figma. Before that I spent fourteen years at Google where I worked on Google Docs, Google Calendar, Google Mobile Maps, and GV. I've written a lot about the craft of product management on my personal website, at [kennorton.com](https://www.kennorton.com).
