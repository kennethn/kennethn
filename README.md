### Hi there, I'm Ken Norton 👋

I'm an [Executive Coach for Product Leaders](https://www.bringthedonuts.com/coaching/). I spent fourteen years at Google where I worked on Google Docs, Google Calendar, Google Mobile Maps, and GV. I've written a lot about the craft of product management on my personal website, at [bringthedonuts.com](https://www.bringthedonuts.com).
